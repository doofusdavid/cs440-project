    "Reinforcement Learning seems like a perfectly valid way to solve a Rubik's cube.  There is quite a bit of tuning to be done.  On the 40 random move test, it started seeing 6 as the correct number of moves after about 2,900 repetitions.  I was training for 20000 repetitions, even reducing that to 5000 would speed it up greatly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I would be interested in using a neural network as the Q value to see how that impacts performance because, while this works, it's a fairly slow process.  I was expecting to be able to migrate this information to create a 3x3 cube, but that didn't seem to be feasible as testing using 40 initial moves ended up taking 10 minutes per iteration.  Doing that with a 3x3 would vastly increase the time needed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The process to change it to 3x3 would be fairly simple, however.  It would only involve changing the initial state to have three rows/columns instead of 2.  `validMoves` would actually be identical, because the accepted cube moves don't include a \"middle\" rotation, so it would still just be left, right, up, down and their primes.  Again, the possibility of adding a Front, Frontprime, Back, Backprime would greatly increase the possible Q table values greatly.\n",
    "\n",
    "`makeMove` would get a little more complicated by adding one to the width and depth.  `winner` would be identical, but it's helper function, `faceComplete` would need to take into account the added width/depth.  "
