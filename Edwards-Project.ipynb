    "I tried using some Python text graphics libraries to display the sides in their actual color, thinking that would make things easier.  I tried using [termcolor](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor) but found that the colors didn't match the actual Rubik's cube colors of Red, Blue, Yellow, Orange, White and Green.  There were existing Rubik's Cube Python libraries like [PyCuber](https://github.com/adrianliaw/PyCuber) and this fancy [interactive cube](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/11/26/3d-interactive-rubiks-cube-in-python/) but I wanted to do as much as possible from scratch.  So, I made the cube a nested list of list of lists.  The lowest level lists represented the top two colors of a side, the next the bottom two colors.  Then, the next level of lists was one whole face of the cube, and the final level was all six sides of the cube."

Same with Down, Right, and Left.  Some had Back as well.  I may simplify these to reduce the size of the Q table.  Up, Up, Up is the same as UpPrime, so I want to minimize the total number of State,ValidMove pairs in the Q table, due to the size of the Rubik's Cube which has [3674160](https://www.therubikzone.com/number-of-combinations/) states.

    "There are a few changes which I should address.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For the Towers of Hanoi, the ideal solution was 7 moves, but for a rubik's cube, it could be much larger.  I had to place some code to display some feedback as it was executing.  In fact, the first time I ran this, it ended up running for 3 straight days over a weekend on a computer at work.  That was when I discovered a few bugs.  I had defined `winner` such that a face with the top two colors matching, and the bottom two colors matching, even if they weren't all the same color was `True.`  This resulted in a trainQ that never completed.  \n",
    "2. The possible length of Q (29393280, which I got from multiplying the possible states above, by 8 different moves) resulted in a great many Q values that weren't traversed yet.  During testQ, this line: \n",
    "\n",
    "`Qs = np.array([Q.get(getTuple(state, m), -1000.0) for m in goodMoves])` \n",
    "\n",
    "used to be \n",
    "\n",
    "`Qs = np.array([Q.get(getTuple(state, m), 0.0) for m in goodMoves])`  \n",
    "\n",
    "This would return a 0.0 for a number of possible moves (any which weren't tested during the trainQ function), and given that the next line did an np.argmax on those values, the 0.0 was often larger than other Q values which actually had been traversed.  I changed the \"default\" value if that Q value didn't exist to be -1000.0, thinking that anything larger than that would be preferable.  This seems to work out pretty well."

    "Using this, I needed to figure out a way to test it.  My first thought was to create a random cube, but then I remembered a problem with that in an earlier assignement.  A puzzle can't necessarily be solved if it was completely randomly shuffled.  Randomly shuffling a Rubik's cube would be akin to peeling off the stickers and putting them in random places.  It's possible that there would be a solution, but also possible that a corner which has three faces could have all three faces Red, which couldn't be solved.  So, I created a shuffled cube, starting from the solved state."
